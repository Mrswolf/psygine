## About The Project

This project is a toolkit that I use personally for processing various biomedical signals. The long-term goal is to make it a research platform that can easily deal with different tasks in biomedical domains. Obviously, the project is under development. 

Currently I am focusing on the following topics: 
- Brain-computer Interface
- Magnetic Resonance Imaging

## My Philosophy
- Algorithms in the package should be well-validated and effective at least for a certain type of task.
- I would like to implement these algorithms personally to learn the details (although I donâ€™t always understand them).
- Some interesting things that are irrelevant to the topic are acceptable.
- Well-documented code!

## Getting Started
### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Mrswolf/psygine.git
   ```
2. Change to the project directory
   ```sh
   cd psygine
   ```
3. Install psygine package with the editable mode
   ```sh
   pip install -e .
